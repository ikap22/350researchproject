      <p>Among all companies that are successful, there is a common trend of giving employeesâ€™ freedom to innovate and make decisions. Companies such as Netflix and Instagram highly encourage employees to make their own decisions and take ownership of their works. This led to Netflix and Instagram being able to introduce new features quickly. In addition, companies that have transparent communication between employees especially with the higher management are also found to be successful. DuckDuckGo and Stripe are prime examples of having a network structure where employees are treated as equal to their superiors. </p>
      <p>Though every tech company researched has had substantial backings from investments, a common trend among those not successful include mismanagement of both finances and internal management. A lack of flexibility and failure to adapt to the market led to the downfall of Kiko and Zume. On the other end, a lack of rigid work structure and no singular vision crippled Crowdmix throughout its entire development. Overpromising was a frequent issue, as the promised scope of features often grew beyond realistic developer capabilities. Strong leadership was also often missing among these unsuccessful projects, especially within WeWork, Zume, and Crowdmix.</p>
      <p>Mismanagement was often the downfall of the tech companies researched. Many of their mistakes, such as lavish misspendings, improper internal structuring and cultures, and unfocused visions all could have been avoided. Though a company may be backed by hefty investments and promising features, management must be handled with care to avoid going under.</p>
